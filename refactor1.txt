After the first few problems it's clear the extent to which problems will build on each other (yes, I read 
the web page) in a way that makes having libraries useful. 

We need a way to organize the following... ...there are n problems, each with k solutions, so the solutions
can be numbered n-k. There may be solutions in multiple compiled languages so we name directories for the languages
and number the files like 
C/1-1.c
C/1-2.c
...
C/2-1.c
...
python/1-1.py
...
ruby/1-1.rb
...
